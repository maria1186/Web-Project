# Claritin of Bayer

This is the old site for Bayer's Claritin drug. I removed the Foundation framework because there were too many security warnings. I chose Tailwind CSS, I like to learn new things. I livened up the site a bit with effects. From the 221 MB size of the old site, the new one is 7.78 MB.  
My efforts were worth it.

## Improvements and Testing

- Removed the Foundation framework due to numerous security warnings and replaced it with Tailwind CSS to modernize the styling and improve maintainability.
- Optimized the site size significantly, reducing it from 221 MB to 7.78 MB, resulting in faster load times and better user experience.
- Introduced **Jest** for unit testing mainly to familiarize myself with the testing framework, ensuring code reliability and facilitating easier maintenance when needed.
- Refactored the JavaScript code by extracting the `toggleHiddenClass` function from `custom.js` into its own module (`toggleHiddenClass.js`), promoting better code organization and reusability.
- Enhanced the site with subtle effects to provide a livelier and more engaging user interface.

These changes contribute to a more secure, maintainable, and performant website.
